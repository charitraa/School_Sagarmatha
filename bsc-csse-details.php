												Computer Science & Software Engineering is at the core
												of modern technology and at the heart of a number of
												specialist technology fields. B.Sc Computer Science &
												Software Engineering course is aimed at providing a
												foundation as well as a platform for specialist study
												in the second and third stages, during which you will
												learn in depth, the principles and practices of both
												disciplines computer science and software engineering.
												<br />
												The disciplines of B.Sc Computer Science and Software
												Engineering are central to many of today’s commercial
												and industrial activities, as well as providing a
												diverse and rapidly developing field for personal
												study. This course is designed to enable you to
												analyze and build a range of applications. Emphasis is
												on the entire software development lifecycle, and the
												production of high-quality software systems using
												object-oriented (OO) methods and tools. You’ll explore
												the entire systems development life-cycle, as well as
												comprehensively covering OO methods.
												<br />
												The final-stage project enables you to take your
												specialist work to greater depth, leading to the
												possibility of future research. The emphasis of the
												course is to provide vocationally skilled programmers
												and software engineers who have both a general
												overview of computer science and software engineering,
												with a more detailed knowledge of fields like internet
												programming, database applications, artificial
												intelligence applications or networking.
